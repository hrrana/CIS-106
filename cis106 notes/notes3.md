 	Exploring Desktop Environment
Desktop Environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of computer operating system, which shares a common GUI, sometimes described as a graphical shell. 

On windows and macOS the user is limited to a single GUI and DE. However, with Linux, the GUI choice are overwhelming and flexible.

A DE provides a predetermined look and feel to the GUI.

**What is a shell?**
Shell makes largest-scale IT possible. They are necessary component to modern computing. The bash shell is shipped with almost every computer in the world. 

**The Linux Terminal:**
CLI: the command-line interface is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines.
There are two ways to access CLI: terminal emulator, Linux console.

**The Bash Shell:**
The GNU bash shell is a program that provides interactive access to the Linux system.
It runs as a regular program and is normally started whenever a user logs in into a terminal.
Most Linux distributions use the bash shell as the default shell. However, other shells exist.

**The Linux filesystem**
There are a lot of file managers option for Linux.
The filesystem is like a tree where every branch represents a directory (folder).
The directory where you are now is called current working directory or present working directory.
In a filesystem, every file has a pathname which indicated the location of the files in the filesystem.

**Commands to move around the file:**
Pwd – used for displaying current working directory.
Cd – used for changing directory.
Ls – to display files inside a given directory.

Types of pathname:
Absolute path
Relative path
