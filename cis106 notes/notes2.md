**What is Virtualization?**
Replication of hardware to stimulate a virtual machine inside a physical machine is called virtualization. 
 	Benefits:
It allows to run multiple Oss on one machine.
It allows to test applications before installing them to host machine.
It reduces cost as there is no need to buy a physical hardware for operating different Oss.
It allows to experiment with untested program, without infecting host machine.
It is hard for a hacker to hack it and so the data remains safer.
 	Virtual box
It runs on:
	Windows
	Linux
	Macintosh	
	Solaris
It supports many guest operating systems.
 	After installing virtual machine how to prepare it?
Steps:
Name your machine and operating system.
Add Memory size.
Create Hard disk.
Select hard disk file type.
Select storage from physical hard disk.
Setup file location and size
Once done with this step, and your machine is successfully setup, change the machine setting as needed.
After setting it up turn on your machine and follow the prompts.
