Research free software/open-source software alternatives.



1.	What are the advantages of open source? Open sources software are high quality software, integrated management. Open source software is mostly high-quality software. When you use the open source software, the source code is available. By using open source software, you can benefit from integrated management. Open source software uses technologies, such as, common information model (CIM) and web based enterprise management (WBEM).
2.	What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source? “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
3.	Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version? People should use free software/open source instead of proprietary version because it is not accessible to the public for a Source code. Open source is open to the public with more products to use. Ex. Firefox, WordPress. 
4.	Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. The terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of programs. Therefore, I do not agree with free software. When we call software “free,” we mean that it respects the user’s essential freedom, the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.
