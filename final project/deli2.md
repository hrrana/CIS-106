**The resources that are being used to complete the final project are:**

Raspberry pie 4 connected to a desktop/television.

32-64 gb sd card

In order to complete the project, I learned about raspberry pie, which I never knew exist. I learned how to set it up, and connect, and how to use it and to give commands. Also, I am learning how to create my own drop box alternative, so I donâ€™t have to pay for it and its my own.
